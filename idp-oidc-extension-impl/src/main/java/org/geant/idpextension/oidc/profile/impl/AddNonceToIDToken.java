 * Authentication Request to the ID Token. If present in the ID Token, Clients
 * MUST verify that the nonce Claim Value is equal to the value of the nonce
 * parameter sent in the Authentication Request. If present in the
 * Authentication Request, Authorization Servers MUST include a nonce Claim in
 * the ID Token with the Claim Value being the nonce value sent in the
 * Authentication Request. Authorization Servers SHOULD perform no other
 * processing on nonce values used. The nonce value is a case sensitive string.
